# K2-tweaks
This mod adds various minor tweaks to the [Krastorio2](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Krastorio2) Factorio mod.

In 0.1.0 version, the mod only alters the recipes and tech tree. Any of the changes can be enabled or disabled individually.

## List of changes:
* Any building that does not require liquid can now be crafted by hand. This applies to **Express underground belt**, **Express splitter** and **Nuclear reactor**, and added for consistency with other belts and reactors, and buildings overall.
* **Engine unit** can now be crafted by hand. This is the unique case in Vanilla Factorio where Engine unit is the only item that does not require liquids and cannot be crafted by hand, so this option is added for the player's taste and is disabled by default.
* Use different icons for the ore-to-intermediate product recipes in **Advanced assembling machine**.
* Use **Raw rare metals** in imersite-based ore-to-intermediate product recipes for **Advanced assembling machine**.
* Enable processing of enriched ores directly to the intermediate products for **Advanced assembling machine**.
